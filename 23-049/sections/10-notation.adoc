== Notation

There are often widely agreed, commonly accepted, notations used for temporal reference systems, but few have been standardized. Any particular notation may be capable of expressing a wider range of times than are valid for the reference system.

[example]
The <<rfc3339>> timestamp notation, a restrictive profile of <<iso8601>>, can express times before 1582CE, when the Gregorian calendar was first introduced in some parts of the world.
