== Temporal regimes

=== General

To more clearly think about time, this Abstract Specification adopts the term “Regime” to describe the fundamentally different types of time and its measurement. This is a pragmatic approach that allows the grouping of recommendations and best practices in a practical way, but without obscuring the connection to the underlying theoretical components.

The first three regimes, described below, have deep underlying physical and mathematical foundations which cannot be legislated away. The fourth regime, calendars, uses a seemingly random mixture of ad hoc algorithms, arithmetic, numerology and measurements. Paradoxically, the calendar regime has historically driven advances in mathematics and physics.

With due consideration, the regimes are applicable to other planets and outer space.

=== Events and Operators

The simplest way of relating entities in time is by events that can be ordered and established in a sequence, and this sequence is used as an approximate measure of the passage of time.

In this regime, no clocks or time measurements are defined, only events, that are ordered in relation to each other. Examples are geological layers, sediment or ice core layers, archaeological sequences, sequential entries in computer logs without coordinated time.

One set of events may be completely ordered with respect to each other, but another set of similar internally consistent ordered events cannot be cross-referenced to each other unless extra information is available. Even then, only partial orderings may be possible.

In this regime, the <<temporal_knowledge,Allen Operators>> (see <<fig-interval-relations>>) can be used. If A occurs before B and B occurs before C, then that A occurs before C can be correctly deduced. The full set of operators also covers pairs of intervals. So in our example, B occurs in the interval (A,C). However, arithmetic operations like (B-A) or (C-A) cannot be performed as any timescale or measurements are not defined. For example, in geology, 'subtracting' Ordovician from Jurassic is meaningless. In archeology, 'subtracting' a layer with a certain type of pottery remains from the layer containing burnt wood and bones is again not meaningful. Only the ordering can be deduced.

This regime constitutes an Ordinal Temporal Reference System, with discrete enumerated ordered events.

=== Simple Clocks and Discrete Timescales

In this regime, a clock is defined as any regularly repeating physical phenomena, such as pendulum swings, earth's rotation about the sun, earth's rotation about its axis, heart beats, vibrations of electrically stimulated quartz crystals or the resonance of the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium-133 atom. In terms of the number of repetitions possible, some phenomena make better clocks than others, because of the consistency of each repetition and the precision of each 'tick'. A mechanism for counting, or possibly measuring, the ticks is desirable.

An assumption is that the ticks are regular and homogeneous.

There is no sub-division between two successive clock ticks. Measuring time consists of counting the complete number of repetitions of ticks since the clock started, or since some other event at a given clock count.

There is no time measurement before the clock starts, or after it stops.

It may seem that time can be measured between 'ticks' by interpolation, but this needs another clock, with faster ticks. This process of devising more precise clocks continues down to the atomic scale. At that scale the deterministic process of physically trying to interpolate between ticks is not possible.

The internationally agreed atomic time, TAI, is an example of a timescale with an integer count as the measure of time. However in practice, TAI is an arithmetic compromise across about two hundred separate atomic clocks, corrected for differing altitudes and temperatures.

In this regime, <<temporal_knowledge,Allen Operators>> (see <<fig-interval-relations>>) also can be used. If L occurs before M and M occurs before N, that L occurs before N can be correctly deduced. The full set of operators also covers pairs of intervals. So if M occurs in the interval (L,N),  integer arithmetic operations such as (M-L) or (N-L) can be performed. This is because an integer timescale or measurement is defined.

This regime constitutes a Temporal Coordinate Reference System, with discrete integer units of measure which can be subject to integer arithmetic.

=== CRS and Continuous Timescales

This regime takes a clock from the previous regime and assumes that between any two adjacent ticks, it is possible to interpolate indefinitely to finer and finer precision, using ordinary arithmetic, rather than any physical device. Units of Measure may be defined that are different from the 'ticks'. For example, a second may be defined as 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the ground-state hyperfine transition of the cesium-133 atom. Alternatively and differently, a second may be defined as 1/86400th of the rotation of the earth on its axis with respect to the sun. The count of rotations is the 'ticks' of an earth-day clock. This latter definition is not precise enough for many uses, as the rotation of the earth on its axis varies from day to day.

Alternatively, it may be that the ticks are not counted but measured, and the precision of the clock is determined by the precision of the measurements, such as depth in an ice core, or angular position of an astronomical body, such as the sun, moon or a star.

It is also assumed that time can be extrapolated to before the time when the clock started and into the future, possibly past when the clock stops.

This gives us a continuous number line to perform theoretical measurements. This is a coordinate system. With a datum/origin/epoch, a unit of measure (a name for the 'tick marks' on the axis), positive and negative directions and the full range of normal arithmetic. This is a Coordinate Reference System (CRS).

In this regime, the <<temporal-knowledge,Allen Operators>> (see <<fig-interval-relations>>) also can be used. If A occurs before B and B occurs before C, that A occurs before C can be correctly deduced. The full set of operators also covers pairs of intervals. So if B occurs in the interval (A,C), real number arithmetic operations like (B-A) or (C-A) can be performed. This is because a timescale or measurement has been defined, and between any two instants, an infinite number of other instants can be found.

This regime constitutes a Temporal Coordinate Reference System, with a continuous number line and units of measure, which can be subject to the full range of real or floating-point arithmetic.

=== Calendars

In this regime, counts and measures of time are related to the various combinations of the rotations of the earth, moon and sun or other astronomical bodies. 
Typically there is no simple arithmetical connection between calendar systems and timescales. For example, the current civil year count of years in the Current Era (CE) and Before Current Era (BCE) is a very simple calendar, as there is no year zero. That is, Year 14CE – Year 12CE is a duration of 2 years, and Year 12BCE - Year 14BCE is also two years. However Year 1CE - Year 1BCE is one year, not two as there is no year 0CE or 0BCE.

In this regime, the use of the <<temporal_knowledge,Allen Operators>> (see <<fig-interval-relations>>) is not straightforward. If A occurs before B and B occurs before C, then correctly deducing that A occurs before C is not always easy. The full set of Allen Operators also covers pairs of intervals. So in the example, B occurs in the interval (A,C). However, simple arithmetic operations like (B-A) or (C-A) cannot usually be done simply because of the vagaries of the calendar algorithms, multiple timescales, and multiple Units of Measure.

Calendars are social constructs made by combining several clocks and their associated timescales.

This Abstract Specification only addresses the internationally agreed Gregorian calendar. The book <<calendrical,Calendrical Calculations>> by Nachum Dershowitz and Edward M. Reingold provides overwhelming detail for conversion to numerous other calendars that have developed around the world and over the millennia and to meet the various social needs of communities, whether agricultural, religious or other. The reference is comprehensive but not exhaustive, as there are calendars that have been omitted.

A Calendar is a Temporal Reference System, but it is not a Temporal Coordinate Reference System nor an Ordinal Temporal Reference System.

=== Other Regimes

There are other regimes, which are out of scope of this Abstract Specification. This could include local solar time, which is useful, for example, for the calculation of illumination levels and the length of shadows on aerial photography, or relativistic time.

==== Local Solar Time

Local solar time may or may not correspond to the local statutory or legal time in a country. Local solar time can be construed as a clock and timescale, with an angular measure of the apparent position of the sun along the ecliptic (path through the sky) as the basic physical principle. But the sun does not appear to progress evenly along the ecliptic throughout the days and year. There may be variations of up to 15 minutes compared to an even angular speed

==== Astronomical Time

Astronomers have traditionally measured the apparent locations of stars, planets and other heavenly bodies by measuring angular separations from reference points or lines and the timing of transits across a meridian. Generally astronomers use time determined by earth's motion relative to the distant stars rather than the sun. This is called sidereal time. Times are usually measured from an epoch in daylight, such as local midday, rather than midnight. Accurate measurements of positions of stars, planets and moons were and are essential for navigation on Earth. See <<astro_algo,Astronomical Algorithms>> by Jean Meeus for examples of the calculations involved.

==== Space-time

When dealing with moving objects, the location of the object in space depends on its location in time. That is to say, location is an event in space and time.

Originally developed by <<minkowski,Hermann Minkowski>> to support work in Special Relativity, the concept of space-time is useful whenever the location of an object in space is dependent on its location in time.

Since the speed of light, stem:[c], in a vacuum is a measurable constant, space-time uses that constant to create a coordinate axis with spatial units of measure (meters per second * seconds = meters). The result is coordinate reference system with four orthogonal axes all with the same units of measure, that is, distance. However, the measure of distance in this 4D space is not the usual Pythagorean stem:[d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +(ct)^2] but stem:[d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -(ct)^2], so reality is constrained to lying within a double cone subset around the stem:[ct] axis of the full space.

==== Relativistic

A regime may be needed for 'space-time', off the planet Earth, such as for recording and predicting space weather approaching from the sun, where the speed of light and relativistic effects such as gravity may be relevant.

Once off planet Earth, distances and velocities can become very large. The speed of light becomes a limiting factor in measuring both where and when an event takes place. Special Relativity deals with the accurate measurement of space-time events as measured between two moving objects. The core concepts are the <<lorentz_transform,Lorentz Transforms>>. These transforms allow one to calculate the degree of "contraction" a measurement undergoes due to the relative velocity between the observing and observed object.

The key to this approach is to ensure each moving feature of interest has its own local clock and time, known as its 'proper time'. This example can be construed as a fitting into the clock and timescale regime. The relativistic effects are addressed through the relationships between the separate clocks, positions and velocities of the features.

Relativistic effects may need to be considered for satellites and other spacecraft because of their relative speed and position in Earth's gravity well.

The presence of gravitational effects requires special relativity to be replaced by general relativity, and it can no longer be assumed that space (or space-time) is Euclidean. That is, Pythagoras' Theorem does not hold except locally over small areas. This is somewhat familiar territory for geospatial experts.

==== Accountancy

The financial and administrative domains often use weeks, quarters, and other calendrical measures. These may be convenient (though often not!) for the requisite tasks, but are usually inappropriate for scientific or technical purposes.
