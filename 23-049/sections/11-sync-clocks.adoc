== Synchronization of clocks

If there are two or more clocks, stationary with respect to each other, and a practical method of communicating their times to each other, the clocks can be perfectly synchronized.

However, if the clocks are moving with respect to each other, perfect synchronization would require communication to be instantaneous. As communication speed is limited by the finite constant speed of light, perfect synchronization is not possible, though repetitive protocols can be used to reduce the synchronization error to any practical desired level.
