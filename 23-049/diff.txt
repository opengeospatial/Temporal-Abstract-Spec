The full set of operators also covers pairs of intervals. So in our example, B occurs in the interval (A,C). However, we cannot perform arithmetic operations like (B-A) or (C-A) as we have not defined any timescale or measurements. For example, in geology, 'subtracting' Ordovician from Jurassic is meaningless; or in archeology, 'subtracting' a layer with a certain type of pottery remains from the layer containing burnt wood and bones is again not meaningful.
