# Abstract Specification on Time

This repo is for the OGC Temporal Domain Working Group to develop an Abstract Specification for Time to be part of the [Abstract Specifications](https://www.ogc.org/docs/as), described in more detail in [OGC Abstract Specification Topic 0](https://docs.ogc.org/as/04-084r4/04-084r4.html) 

The current OGC standards generally refer to the ISO documents such as [ISO 19108](https://www.iso.org/standard/26013.html), [ISO 19111](https://www.iso.org/standard/74039.html), and their freely available OGC equivalents, such as [Abstract Specification Topic 2 Referencing by Coordinates](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/as/18-005r4/18-005r4.html#44).

Much effort over decades has gone into establishing complex structures to represent calendar based time, such as the ISO8601 notation, and many date-time schemas. Because of this effort, many people use calendar based "coordinates", with the attendant ambiguities, imprecision and inappropriate scope.

The aim of the document is to establish a clear terminology, so that people are clearly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of adopting a particular technological approach and then perhaps help build better interoperable systems.

Further work is to develop and recommend best practices for handling temporal concepts, coordinates, attributes and properties in various technical environments.

The current draft documents available from the following locations:

* Charter for the Temporal Domain Working Group as a [PDF](Temporal-Abstract-Spec/Best-Practice/Temporal_Domain_WG_Charter_V0.7.pdf). The approved Charter workplan includes development of Best Practices and the Abstract Specification Topic. 
* Charter (draft) for a Temporal Standard Working Group in [HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/opengeospatial/Temporal-Abstract-Spec/blob/master/Charter/document.html), [PDF](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Temporal-Abstract-Spec/blob/master/Charter/document.pdf), and [Word](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Temporal-Abstract-Spec/blob/master/Charter/document.doc) formats. This is in case any future temporal standards and documents are developed that are not in the scope of the existing Charter.
* Abstract Specification (draft) in [HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/opengeospatial/Temporal-Abstract-Spec/blob/master/23-049/23-049.html), [PDF](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Temporal-Abstract-Spec/blob/master/23-049/23-049.pdf), and [Word](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Temporal-Abstract-Spec/blob/master/23-049/23-049.doc) formats.

## About this document

Instructions on authoring OGC documents using the metanorma toolchain can be found at https://www.metanorma.org/author/ogc/authoring/

If there are any issues or problems with the toolchain, please raise them at https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/issues

Copy in OGC staff by adding @ghobona to the Issue's body.

## To compile the document using a docker image

`docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -v ${HOME}/.fontist/fonts/:/config/fonts  metanorma/mn  metanorma compile --agree-to-terms -t ogc -x xml,html,doc,pdf document.adoc`

NOTE: You need to add the --agree-to-terms option to retrieve licenced fonts.

NOTE: This command caches fonts on your local system.

## Alternative approach for compilation

It is also possible to install the metanorma toolchain locally and to compile the document using the local instance of metanorma.
